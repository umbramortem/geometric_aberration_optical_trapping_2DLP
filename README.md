Geometric aberrations in the 3D profile of microparticles observed in optical trappings using 2D Legendre polynomials
In this repository you will find the Zernike coefficients (a total of 1326 coefficients per sample) computed using Eq.4 in the work by Arriaga et al. 2021 (submitted).  The equation was used with m=50, and the coefficients were computed for two test microparticles per sample. We also include the mean coefficients per sample.
