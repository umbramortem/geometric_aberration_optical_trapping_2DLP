# geometric_aberration_optical_trapping_2DLP
Geometric aberrations in the 3D profile of microparticles observed in optical trappings using 2D Legendre polynomials.

In this repository you will find the Zernike coefficients (a total of 1326 coefficients per sample) computed using Eq.4 in the work by Arriaga et al. 2021 (submitted).  The equation was used with m=50, and the coefficients were computed for two test microparticles per sample. We also include the mean coefficients per sample.

Applying our proposed Gerchberg-Saxton modification with the 2DLP (Fig. 3 in the article), we obtain the phase, and subsequently, from the reported symmetry of the microparticles, we can reconstruct the whole three-dimensional profile for each MP in each one of the four samples.  We use Blender to model the 3D object with the minima measurements in the minor diameter and the reported ones in the major diameter.  We placed the isophotes shown in Fig. 6 (in the article) as stickers of texture over the 3D object in Blender, giving place to a 3D object with .glb extension.  Such files can be visualized in any 3D object application such as Paint 3D, acrobat, blender, auto cad, photoshop, etc. These files are labeled as “minimum_sample” with  t=1,2,3,4 for each sample.
